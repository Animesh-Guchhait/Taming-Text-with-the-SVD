# Taming-Text-with-the-SVD

Abstract
In SAS Text Miner, vector space models are used to represent text. In this framework, we consider distinct words of documents as variables and each document is
considered as observation. But in this process the number of variables becomes
too enormous to handle. As a result, dimension reduction becomes a crucial aspect of text mining solutions to easily model the documents. In order to reduce
dimension we used Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) and Principal Components
Analysis(PCA) on the class of documents and compare the results.
